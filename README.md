## Tech Stack

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webpack, Jest

## Features

- **Web-based Game**: Developed a 10x10 grid Battleship game where users can play against a computer opponent.
- **Drag-and-Drop Placement**: Implemented drag-and-drop functionality for intuitive ship placement, with collision detection for accurate placement on the grid.
- **Computer Targeting Logic**: Designed the computer's targeting system using array methods (map, filter, some) to track moves and optimize attacks based on previous hits and misses.
- **Random Ship Placement**: Developed an algorithm to randomly place the computer's ships, ensuring varied gameplay in each session.
- **Modular Code**: Utilized JavaScript classes to organize the game logic and ensure maintainability of the code.
- **Test-Driven Development**: Used Jest for unit testing to ensure the game's core logic is reliable and functions as expected.
- **User Experience Enhancements**: Integrated animations, sound effects, and CSS transitions to create an immersive and responsive user interface.
- **Webpack Integration**: Configured Webpack for efficient bundling of assets, optimizing both development and production workflows.
